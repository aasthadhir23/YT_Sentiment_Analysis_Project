This information is used to make important business decisions. Some key features that are extracted from the analysis are polarity (positive or negative), facts (objective statements), and opinions (people's point of view). This project uses YouTube comment data to analyze sentiment responses to videos. The main goal of this project is to perform advanced textual analysis on YouTube comment data using the popular open source platform R.
